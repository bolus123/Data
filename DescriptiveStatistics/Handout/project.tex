This handout will introduce a basic use of R with an example describing a data.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Load a data. Here, I will receive a CSV file from my Github. You can also load a data from different types of data source such as Excel, databases and etc.. This data is monitoring difference manufacturing processes about Automobile Engine Piston Rings, which are theoretically identical and independently distributed.(Each column is standing for one of processes). 
		\begin{itemize}
			\item R code
				\begin{verbatim}
				# Load table from my Github
				add <- 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bolus123/Data
				/master/data1.csv'
				data <- as.matrix(read.csv(file = add))
				data
				\end{verbatim}
		\end{itemize}		
	\item The empirical distribution
		\begin{itemize}
			\item R code
				\begin{verbatim}
				 # Gra
